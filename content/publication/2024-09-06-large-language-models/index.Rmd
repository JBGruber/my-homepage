abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement for the field of political communication. Their capabilities for the study of language vastly surpass previous approaches, enabling a wider and more generalized array of applications.
The introduction of models like BERT revolutionized political communication research by enhancing the accuracy of text classification tasks. However, it was the release of ChatGPT that captured widespread public attention, establishing LLMs as a cornerstone of artificial intelligence in public perception.

This entry examines the role of LLMs in political communication research, tracing their development, key concepts, and discussing opportunities and challenges. LLMs can reduce costs while improving accuracy compared to traditional methods of content analysis. Generative LLMs (gLLMs), such as those developed by OpenAI, have pushed the boundaries of text understanding and generation. Besides these advancements, significant concerns remain regarding biases, reproducibility, and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges is crucial for harnessing the potential of LLMs.'

[Fabio](https://www.favstats.eu/) and I were asked to write up a short explainer of large language models (LLMs) in Political Communication for the *Elgar Encyclopedia of Political Communication*.
While brief, I think this piece contains many important points about the potentials for progress, but also harm, in communication research.
The encyclopedia will come out in 2025, by which time there will be many new developments in the field of LLMs, I assume.
But I also believe that the main features in terms of advantages and pitfalls will not dramatically change.
