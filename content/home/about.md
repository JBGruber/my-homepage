# Background

I am a Post-Doc Researcher at the Chair for Digital Democracy at the European New School of Digital Studies (ENS), European University Viadrina Foundation Frankfurt (Oder). I recently passed my PhD in Politics at the University of Glasgow.

In my PhD project, I scrutinised how the media in the UK portrays protest events. Most literature about the topic assumes that the messages of protests are delegitimised by the media through routinised framing, i.e. a focus on disruption by and deviance of protesters. 
In my project, I collected all newspaper articles published in selected UK newspaper outlets that mention a protest in the UK over a 26 year period (1992-2017; N > 27,000) and analysed the content using an innovative approach to framing analysis that combines best-practice manual coding techniques with supervised machine learning.

After a detour that included a Master on Political Theory, I realised during my Master in Political Communication --- which was originally planned as a semester abroad --- how much I love working with data. 
Especially **R**, the free software environment for statistical computing and graphics, is captivating much of my attention nowadays and has helped me to combine my two most long-standing passions:
Political Science and fiddling with computers.
I'm using **R** to do nearly everything (including writing my thesis and this website).
