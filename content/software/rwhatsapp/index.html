abstract: '`rwhatsapp` is a small yet robust package that provides some infrastructure to work with WhatsApp text data in `R`. WhatsApp seems to become increasingly important not just as a messaging service but also as a social networkâ€”thanks to its group chat capabilities. This package is intended to make the first step of analysing WhatsApp text data as easy as possible: reading your chat history into R. This should work, no matter which device or locale you used to retrieve the txt or zip file containing your conversations.'
