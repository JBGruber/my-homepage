abstract: 'The philosophy of `paperboy` is that the package is a comprehensive collection of webscraping scripts for news media sites. Many data scientists and researchers write their own code when they have to retrieve news media content from websites. At the end of research projects, this code is often collecting digital dust on researchers hard drives instead of being made public for others to employ. paperboy offers writers of webscraping scripts a clear path to publish their code and earn co-authorship on the package. For users, the promise is simple: paperboy delivers news media data from many websites in a consistent format.'
