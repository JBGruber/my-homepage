Like [last year](https://www.johannesbgruber.eu/post/you-r-my-valentine/) I wanted to make something special for my wonderful R-Lady. This year the main work was done by the very talented Will Chase, who makes wonderful aRt including the [animation this post is based on](https://www.williamrchase.com/post/2019/07/29/textures-and-geometric-shapes-12-months-of-art-july#animated-color-gradients). All I did to change the original animation was to cut it into a heart shape and carve our initials into the center. Enjoy:

library(poissoned)

# generate points
pts <- poisson_disc(ncols = 150, nrows = 400, cell_size = 2, 
                    xinit = 150, yinit = 750, keep_idx = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(idx)

# generate heart shape
hrt_dat <- data.frame(t = seq(0, 2 * pi, by = 0.01)) %>%
  bind_rows(data.frame(t = rep(max(.$t), 300))) %>% 
  mutate(xhrt = 16 * sin(t) ^ 3,
         yhrt = 13 * cos(t) - 5 * cos(2 * t) - 2 * cos(3 * t) - cos(4 * t),
         frame = seq_along(t)) %>% 
  mutate(xhrt = scales::rescale(xhrt, c(min(pts$x), max(pts$x))),
         yhrt = scales::rescale(yhrt, c(min(pts$y), max(pts$y))))
 
# identify points within the heart shape
inside <- sp::point.in.polygon(point.x = pts$x, 
                               point.y = pts$y, 
                               pol.x = hrt_dat$xhrt,
                               pol.y = hrt_dat$yhrt,
