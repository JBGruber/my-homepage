After a hiatus of three years already(!) I wanted to make another Valentine's post.
Like [in 2019](https://www.johannesbgruber.eu/post/you-r-my-valentine/) and [2020](https://www.johannesbgruber.eu/post/you-r-my-valentine-2-0/) I wanted to make something special for my wonderful R-Lady.
I tried to figure `rayshader` out for a while now and tried to make a heart shape map first.
After some failed attempts I noticed you can also turn `ggplot2` objects into 3-D objects, which is absolutely amazing.
So without further ado, here is some code:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(rayshader)
library(tidyverse)

# make data for one heart
hrt_dat <- data.frame(t = seq(0, 2 * pi, by = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(xhrt = 16 * sin(t) ^ 3,
         yhrt = 13 * cos(t) - 5 * cos(2 * t) - 2 * cos(3 * t) - cos(4 * t))

# replicate the same 50 times, decreasing radius each time
hrt_dat_all <- map2_df(seq(from = 1, to = 0.05, length.out = 50),
                       seq_len(50),
                       function(x, i) {
                         hrt_dat %>% 
                           mutate(xhrt = xhrt * x,
                                  yhrt = yhrt * x,
                                  run = log10(i))
                       })

# make plot in ggplot
hrt <- ggplot(hrt_dat_all, aes(xhrt, yhrt, colour = run)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.9, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("#F37374", "#F48181", "#F58D8D","#FF9999",
                                   "#FFA3A3","#FFA699", "#FFB399", "#FFB399",
                                   "#FFC099", "#FFC099","#FFCC99", "#FFCC99"),
                                   guide = "none") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, colour = NULL) +
  theme_light()

# transform to rayshader plot and render out as video
plot_gg(hrt, width = 4, height = 4, scale = 300, multicore = TRUE, shadowcolor = "#3a4f70")
render_movie("heart3d.mp4", frames = 180, fps = 15)
```
