I'm happy to announce that `traktok`, my package to get content from TikTok, has returned from the dead.
That's slightly exaggerated, because it actually always worked in some shape or form, but up until about September, the most recent state on Github had very limited functionality.
Now I extended the package substantially and also gave it an appealing home on a `pkgdown` site here: <https://jbgruber.github.io/traktok/>.

The main issue I had before, [namely that some requests to the unofficial TikTok API need to be signed](https://github.com/JBGruber/traktok/issues/5), still remains unresolved.
But the remaining functions are now much more stable.
I have also moved the 'authentication'for the unofficial API to a separate package, `cookiemonster`, since it seemed silly to maintain two different code bases for using cookies in `R` (the other place being in [`paperboy`](https://github.com/JBGruber/paperboy/), which I will discuss here soon).

However, what is new is that `traktok` now supports the Research API!
This was actually also an issue because it required me to decide on a new naming scheme.
I landed on keeping most of the functions, but writing separate version for whether you have Research API access or not.
But I think the most analysis projects will profit from being able to mix and match functions from both APIs:

| Description                 | Shorthand        | Research API       | Hidden API              |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------|:-------------------|:------------------------|
| search videos               | tt_search        | tt_search_api      | tt_search_hidden        |
| get video detail (+file)    | tt_videos        | \-                 | tt_videos_hidden        |
| get user videos             | tt_user_info     | tt_user_info_api   | \-                      |
| get comments under a video  | tt_comments      | tt_comments_api    | \-                      |
| get who follows a user      | tt_get_follower  | \-                 | tt_get_follower_hidden  |
| get who a user is following | tt_get_following | \-                 | tt_get_following_hidden |
| get raw video data          | \-               | \-                 | tt_request_hidden       |
| authenticate a session      | \-               | auth_research      | auth_hidden             |

- To get started with the unofficial/hidden API, you can have a look here: <https://jbgruber.github.io/traktok/articles/unofficial-api.html>
- If you have access to the Research API or want to apply for it, have a look at this: <https://jbgruber.github.io/traktok/articles/research-api.html>

You can install the package from GitHub.
I'm not sure if it will ever be released on CRAN, since I'm not entirely sure they would be happy with the reverse engineering of a hidden API (but let me know if you think otherwise).

```
pak::pak("JBGruber/traktok")
```

For a very quick demonstration, let's look up some videos about `R` on TikTok (this will only work after authenticating):

```{r}
library(traktok)
rstats_vids_urls <- tt_search("#rstats", max_pages = 1L, verbose = FALSE)
rstats_vids_urls
```

If you want to download these videos as well:

```{r}
dir.create("videos", showWarnings = FALSE)
tt_videos(rstats_vids_urls$video_url, dir = "videos", verbose = FALSE)
tibble::tibble(file = list.files("videos"),
               size_Mb = file.size(list.files("videos", full.names = TRUE)) / 1000000)
```

And with these two commands, you already have a small TikTok dataset to play with ðŸ“ŠðŸš€!
