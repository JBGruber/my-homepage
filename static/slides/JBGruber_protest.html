# Motivation

**Accusation:**

- Protesters: the mainstream news media harm protests with unfair reporting.

- Academia: news media hinder protests’ messages from spreading by focusing on details about the event (**‘protest paradigm’**).

--

**However:**

- The time frame and scope of studies have been limited so far.

- Both media and society have changed quite a lot in recent decades → did that change protest reporting (Cottle, 2008)?

- Methodological and technical advances make broader scope possible.

--

***Research Questions:***

1. *Which frames are used by mainstream news media to cover domestic protest events?*
2. *How – if at all – did patterns of protest reporting change over time?*

# Case

- Mainstream news media articles about protests in the UK (1992-2017)

- Time-series design: it is expected that the patterns have changed substantially since the first seminal studies – not least due to the arrival of the internet (Cottle, 2008)

- Data: Population scale sample of protest reports in newspapers (n &gt; 27,000)

# Data

Data downloaded from LexisNexis using "protest" and "demonstration" (plus several variations) before cleaning the data:

&lt;img src="JBGruber_protest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
Full search string in extra slides at the end.
Now this database includes VERY different protest events: from the fuel protests in 2000 in which mainly truckers contested the rising fuel taxes, over pro- and anti-fox hunting marches, Catholic protesters against Protestant marches in Northern Ireland, protests against the Iraq War, and lately anti Brexit protests to hundreds of small one day demonstrations.
This poses a problem then because: [next slide]

# Data cleaning


&lt;img src="JBGruber_protest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
Some of the data cleaning was necessary due to problems with the LexisNexis newspaper database (duplicated articles, articles that do not mention any of the keywords) some cleaning was relatively simple, such as removing articles in the sport or the sport or obituaries section.
More tricky cleaning was necessary due to the theoretically driven definition of protest and the commonness of the selected keywords in other contexts (homonyms).

# Problem:

## How can we find systematic patterns in media reports

## if the reported topics differ?

--

 Idea: **Analyse the framing of a story instead of its content**

???
Analyzing what has and hasn't been said about each event is pretty much impossible, especially since no independent accounts of the events exist.
So how can we find systematic patterns in media reports?
A more systematic approach is to analyse the framing of a story instead of its content.

# What is framing?

--


&lt;center&gt;
.Large[A frame  is a *"a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to an unfolding strip of events"*  (Gamson  &amp; Modigliani,  1987)]
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


Most often used definition of framing in &lt;strong&gt;media studies&lt;/strong&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
.Large["To frame is to *select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular &lt;span style='background-color: #51A8A8'&gt;problem definition&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='background-color: #AFC131'&gt;causal interpretation&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='background-color: #D35126'&gt;moral evaluation&lt;/span&gt;, and/or &lt;span style='background-color: #FFDE77'&gt;treatment recommendation&lt;/span&gt;* for the item described"
(Entman, 1993, original emphasis).]

]


???
Qualitative approaches
- rooted in qualitative research traditions
- proceed inductively
- more about in-depth description
- little or no quantification of elements or the distribution of frames within a discourse is provided by the researcher

Manual-Holistic approaches
- frames are holistic variables
- usually quantitative content analyses
- frames can be either derived from the literature or identified inductively in a pilot study of a small sample
- validity and reliability depend on the transparency with which the study communicates the coding decisions

manual-clustering approaches
- split up frames into sub-variables which are easier to code in content analysis-
- frames are operationalised as a set of yes/no indicator questions (coders are asked if a certain aspect is mentioned in the text or not)
- This seems to be a good approach if documents need to be coded manually.

]



???
Dictionary Methods (deductive)
- First construct a list of words for each frame before texts are categorised using keyword matches
- Provides very fine control over what words determine classification decision
- Very complicated to construct and extremely labour intensive to validate
- Usually heavily theory driven and can't incorporate new classes after first set up
- That's why once a dictionary is constructed it often gets used over and over (which is a bad idea as language changes over time and subjects)

Fully Automated Classification (inductive)
- The exact opposite: no theory is used to construct the classes. In fact no theory can be used!
- The resulting classes are purely a product of algorithmic decisions and the biggest challenge is to validate the latent patterns the computer has found
- For the present case this makes these methods unsuitable as latent Dirichlet allocation, for example, picks up the different topics of the protests rather than their framing

Supervised Machine Learning (SML)
- The only one where we can be relatively sure that we are actually measuring the framing concept rather than word occurrences or latent patterns in which we are not really interested
- Based on training data, i.e., manually coded documents from which the computer 'learns' how to classify documents with a certain composition of different words.
- This approach combined with manual clustering is what I use to measure framing of the reports about protest

???
A straightforward method is used to determine an optimal number of clusters:
The NBclust package in R runs pretty much all indices available on each cluster solution.
Most indices clearly mark an optimal result and the overall best number of clusters is found using a simple majority criterion.
Here we can see that 3 is probably the best option.

# Interpreting Clusters as Frames

Heatmap showing cluster means for codes:


&lt;img src="JBGruber_protest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="2800" /&gt;

???
The cluster are interpreted as frames by checking cluster means for each coding variable.
We have to look for 3 things here:
- high values
- values that are substantially higher in one cluster than in the others
- values that are substantially lower in one cluster than in the others

To aid interpretation, I display the means in a heatmap with high values closer to red and low values in yellow.

We see that it is relatively easy to interpret the clusters:
- The high values for topic clash and violence in the first cluster means we can interpret this as a 'Troublemakers' frame or an incarnation of the protest paradigm. Protesters are made responsible for risks almost exclusively. Interestingly though, the cause of the protest is still often discussed, at least briefly.
- However, there is a substantially larger cluster (at least in the training data) that highlights and discusses the causes behind an event. Here if anybody is responsible for a risk, it's officials. The risk which is not shown here, is mainly caused by the grievance of the protesters.
- The last frame was a bit of a mystery at first since nothings seemed prevalent for quite some time which is why I dubbed it balanced. However adding more documents, it seems that that this is becoming more focused on the clash between protesters and police and other confrontation. Articles in this cluster are generally not as negative as in the Troublemakers frame but you can see a tendency to highlight things that happened rather than why they happened. Cause is least prevalent here among the clusters.

## Three Frames Characterise Protest Reporting



.red[
Troublemakers

- High values in *Clash* and *Violence/Crime* (combined mean of 0.63).
- Main Risk: *Public safety* (0.84); *Property destruction* (0.05) still rel. high.
- Risks Attribution split between protesters (0.39) and police (0.38).
- no positive judgement whatsoever and almost no mention of *Cause*.
- Basically the protest paradigm.

]

.green[
Struggle for (Just) Cause


- Most prevalent topic = *Cause* 0.31 and actor =  *Protesters* (0.91).
- Also common topics: Event (0.31), Spectacle (0.09), and Protesters (0.06).
- The main *benefit* is *(Just) Cause* (0.08); *risk* is most often *Grievance* (0.27).
- *Officials* (0.15) and protesters (0.09) are made responsible.

]

.orange[
Mixed

- It's most distinctive feature is that it has no distinctive feature.
- None of the top topics or actors have particularly high means.
- Slightly negative slant towards protesters (Risk Attribution: Protesters: 0.09, negative judgement: 0.05).
- Manual assessment of articles in this cluster shows that it is **basically a mix of elements from other two clusters**.

# SML replicating classification: 

## F1-scores for different algorithms

&lt;img src="JBGruber_protest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="3800" /&gt;


???
We can see that class one is consistently performing worse than the other classes.
This is the Troublemakers frame and the problem here might be that there is simply not enough available data to train the algorithms.
In the sample of 400 articles, only 60 are in this class.
That means more coding has to be done. 
A general rule of thumb is that 500 articles usually suffices to train the algorithms.
However, since the Troublemakers frame occurs so relatively seldom, it might be necessary to code a few more.

Once this is done, I can finally show some substantial results.

# Change over time

&lt;img src="JBGruber_protest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???
However, we can still see some things:
There little systematic change over time.
While some frames become more prevalent in some years, non seems to become considerably more popular over time.
The second finding is that the coverage protesters receive is not as bad as often thought.
Consistently more than a third of the reporting highlights the cause and struggle of protesters to fight for it.

# Next Steps

.large[
- &lt;strong&gt;Validation:&lt;/strong&gt;
  + Resolve inter-coder reliability problems
  + Improve ML classification for frames 2 &amp; 3
- Outlook:
  + Explain the framing of protest with event data (size, tactics, time after event, ideological stance, etc.)

## Conclusion (preliminary)

### Which frames are used by mainstream news media?

- 3 distinct frames make up the media debate on domestic protest:
*Troublemakes* (protest paradigm), *Struggle for (Just) Cause* and Mixed
- The *Troublemakes* frame is less common than expected.
- Supportive coverage (at least attention to cause) is more prevalent than expected.
- Many articles don't really do either!

--

### Did patterns of protest reporting change over time?

- No systematic change over time, despite changes in media, protest behaviour and social acceptance of protest.
- But protest is covered differently in some years.

--

### Methodologically speaking:

- Clustering approach seems well suited to uncover and code frames (although coding is still complicated).
- Machine learning works to code frames on large scale (although some frames seem very similar to the machine).

# Definition of protest
.Large[
&lt;center&gt;
A &lt;strong&gt;joint&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., collective) overt &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; expression that either articulates grievances against or support for one or multiple targets (i.e., policies, institutions or behaviours) in order to either directly influence an institution’s decision makers or the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours of the public.
&lt;/center&gt;

Also:
- Excluded foreign protest
- Excluded institutional protest (i.e., in parliament)
] 

???
The definition is heavily influenced by theoretical considerations.
In practice, especially foreign protests were mentioned quite regularly, however as noted in the literature, the tone of reporting is quite different with these as journalists and news companies do not have any stakes in these protests.
Especially problematic however is that "protest" and "demonstrations" are very common words in the English language, usually not referring to the practice of protesting as defined here.
This meant that extensive data cleaning was necessary (see next slide).
