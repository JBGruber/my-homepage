# Motivation

- Accusation: the mainstream news media hinder protests’ messages from spreading to the wider forum of public media debate by focusing (solely) on details about the event (clash with police, the appearance of protesters, etc.) (‘protest paradigm’).

- Protest seems crucial for our understanding of the media and the democratic process itself as protesters are one of few non-elite players who can start or shift media debate about a topic.

- Yet the time frame and scope of studies have been limited so far.

- Both media and society have changed quite a lot in recent decades → did that change protest reporting?

- Methodological and technical advances make broader scope possible.

.content-box-blue[
# Case

- Mainstream news media articles about protests in the UK (1992-2017)

- Time-series design: it is expected that the patterns have changed substantially since the first seminal studies – not least due to the arrival of the internet (Cottle, 2008)

- Data: Population scale sample of protest reports in newspapers (n &gt; 27,000)

# Data

Data downloaded from LexisNexis using "protest" and "demonstration" (plus several variations) before cleaning the data:

# Definition of protest

&lt;center&gt;
.Large[A &lt;strong&gt;joint&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e., collective) overt &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; expression that either articulates grievances against or support for one or multiple targets (i.e., policies, institutions or behaviours) in order to either directly influence an institution’s decisionmakers or the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours of the public.] 
&lt;/center&gt;

Also:
- Excluded foreign protest
- Excluded institutional protest (i.e., in parliament)

# Data cleaning


&lt;img src="JBGruber_protest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="2800" /&gt;

???
Theoretically driven definition of protest and the commonness of the selected keywords led to the need for exhaustive data cleaning
Homographs present throughout all steps

# Problem:

## How can we find systematic patterns in media reports

## if the reported topics differ?

--

 Idea: **Analyse the framing of a story instead of its content**

???
I collected coverage containing reports about domestic protest from 26 UK newspaper.
The topics of the protests differ wildly. Between fox-hunting protests, Anti-war protest, high fuel prices and pro- and anti-Brexit protests.

# What is framing?

--


&lt;center&gt;
.Large[A frame  is a *"a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to an unfolding strip of events"*  (Gamson  &amp; Modigliani,  1987)]
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


Most often used definition of framing in &lt;strong&gt;media studies&lt;/strong&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
.Large["To frame is to *select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular &lt;span style='background-color: #51A8A8'&gt;problem definition&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='background-color: #AFC131'&gt;causal interpretation&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='background-color: #D35126'&gt;moral evaluation&lt;/span&gt;, and/or &lt;span style='background-color: #FFDE77'&gt;treatment recommendation&lt;/span&gt;* for the item described"
(Entman, 1993, original emphasis).]

???
Qualitative approaches
- rooted in qualitative research traditions
- proceed inductively
- more about in-depth description
- little or no quantification of elements or the distribution of frames within a discourse is provided by the researcher
Manual-Holistic approaches
- frames are holistic variables
- usually quantitative content analyses
- frames can be either derived from the literature or identified inductively in a pilot study of a small sample
- validity and reliability depend on the transparency with which the study communicates the coding decisions
manual-clustering approaches
- split up frames into sub-variables which are easier to code in content analysis-
- frames are operationalised as a set of yes/no indicator questions (coders are asked if a certain aspect is mentioned in the text or not)

.full-width[.content-box-red[Work in progress (training/test sample n = 300/30)!]]

&lt;!-- - Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Meyer et al., 2011) --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Linear SVM --&gt;
&lt;!-- - multinomial Naïve Bayes from quanteda --&gt;
&lt;!-- - sequential neural network from quanteda.classifiers --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Random Forest(Liaw and Wiener, 2002) --&gt;
&lt;!-- - boosting (Tuszynski, 2012) from caTools --&gt;
&lt;!-- - bagging (Peters et al., 2002) fromipred --&gt;
&lt;!-- - scaled linear discriminant analysis (slda) --&gt;
&lt;!-- - glmnet (Friedman et al., 2010) --&gt;
&lt;!-- - maximum entropy(Jurka, 2012) --&gt;

&lt;!-- Usually it is best to use an ensemble of classifiers together! --&gt;

???
Once this is done, we can show change over time and do some analysis why certain reports are the  way they are (right wing protest, more positive reports from right-wing media?)

# Change over time (very preliminary!)

# Application: Next Steps

.large[
- Finish training sample
- Agreement between coders on training set
- Agreement between coders and clustering
- Agreement between clustering and SML
- Outlook:
  + Explain the framing of protest with event data (size, tactics, time after event, ideogical stance, etc.)
]


---

# Conclusion

- Detected frames make sense

--
- Classification better than chance already

--
- More control over categories than topicmodels
- Less abstract coding and category building than dictionary methods
